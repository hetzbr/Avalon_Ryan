<h1>IT Analyst Intern</h1> 

I spent this past summer in the Twin Cities at 3M where I had two main focuses - working as an IT analyst within a  business group and implementing a web based tool with a team of fellow interns.<br/><br/>

My role as an IT analyst was unique in the sense that I was separate from central IT and much closer to the business. I gained valuable experience as I tackled a wide range of tasks. The most notable being SharePoint migration and development. I quickly learned that an organization with the magnitude of 3M is constantly evolving and adapting to better meet their business goals. As a result, the internal business structure rearranges on a frequent basis. It was my job to reflect these changes within the SharePoint environment. Working with stakeholders along the way was critical to ensure an accurate representation of the business. Additionally, the actual development I performed required great stakeholder interaction to deliver a effective site. This portion of my internship proved to be very rewarding as often times I would see the direct benefit of my work for the business group, an aspect that sometimes is lost in a large IT organization. <br/><br/>

The other key piece of my internship at 3M was spent with a team of interns as we designed and developed an internal health check monitor for the employee social media website. This project, spanning the entire summer, was a great experience as we not only gathered the requirements and completed other design tasks, but actually did the development as well. Our application was written in primarily JavaScript with a UI built using HTML and CSS.The goal of our project was to decrease site downtime and and improve overall user experience. Before our implementation, there was not an automated site monitor to ensure the availability of specific components such as profiles, blogs, communities, ect. By then end of the summer, we were able to cycle our application through the testing environments and place it on a production server. Bringing the project from ground zero to production provided a great learning experience and was a big accomplishment for our team.
